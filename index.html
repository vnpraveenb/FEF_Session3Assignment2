            <h1>Web Development</h1>
            <p> 
                Web programming, also known as web development, is the creation of dynamic web applications. Examples of web applications are social networking sites like Facebook or e-commerce sites like Amazon. <br> <br>
                                
                The good news is that learning web development is not that hard! <br> <br>
                        
                In fact, many argue it is the best form of coding for beginners to learn. It is easy to set up, you get instant results and there&apos;s plenty of online training available.<br> <br>
                        
                A lot of people learn web coding because they want to create the next Facebook or find a job in the industry. But it is also a good choice if you just want a general introduction to coding, since it is super easy to get started. No matter whether you are looking for a career or just want to learn coding, learning how to develop for the web is for you. It is one of the smartest decisions you will ever make!<br> <br>
                        
                There are two broad divisions of web development: front-end development (also called client-side development) and back-end development (also called server-side development).<br> <br>
                        
                Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web application: the content, design and how you interact with it. This is done with three codes: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br> <br>
                        
                HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language, is a special code for &apos;marking up&apos; text in order to turn it into a web page. Every web page on the net is written in HTML, and it will form the backbone of any web application. CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a code for setting style rules for the appearance of web pages. CSS handles the cosmetic side of the web. Finally, JavaScript is a scripting language that&apos;s widely used to add functionality and interactivity to web pages. <br> <br>
                        
                Back-end development controls what goes on behind the scenes of a web application. A back-end often uses a database to generate the front-end. <br> <br>
